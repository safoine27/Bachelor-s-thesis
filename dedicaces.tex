\chapter*{Dedications}

\begin{center}
I want to dedicate this humble work to: \\
\end{center}
\begin{center}
My parents \textbf{Slah Eddine} and \textbf{Hamida} for all the pain they have been through and all the sacrifices they made in order for me to reach this level and for me to be what I am today.\\
\end{center}
\begin{center}
To my siblings, Rihab and Ghofrane and Hassen for their patience, continuous support and care.
\end{center}
\begin{center}
To all the members of my family especially Oussama and my dearest friends: Bacem, Amine, Ghaith, Mokhtar, Malek,  Meriem and all the ones I didnâ€™t mention for the best times and laughs we had and sticking by my side the time I needed. \\
\end{center}
\begin{center}
For all those I love and all those who love me.
To all who helped that I forgot to mention.
\end{center}
