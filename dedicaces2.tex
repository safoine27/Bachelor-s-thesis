\chapter*{Dedications}

\begin{center}
I want to dedicate this work:
\end{center}
\begin{center}
To my father Mohamed for being my guardian during my educational career. To my mother Fattouma who support and encourage  me to believe in myself. 
\end{center}
\begin{center}
To my brother Khalil and my sister Asma who show always the best path to follow. 
\end{center}
\begin{center}
To my friends Ghaith, Amine, Bacem for their help and advice.
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Finally, I would also like to thank everyone who has been involved in this work that I forgot to mention.
